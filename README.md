# Data-Warehouse-Integration

We build a Data Warehouse for our IST 722: Data Warehouse course. We are designing a warehouse for our fictional client, Fudge Corporation Ltd. which is a conglomerate with two subsidiaries in operation â€“ FudgeMart & FudgeFlix. FudgeMart is an online retailer whereas FudgeFlix is an online DVD demand service.  

**Project Aim:**
1. Analyze the needs of these databases and decide what kind of data warehouse can be built to improve business processes and to streamline the workflow.
2. Focus on several parts like security, scalability, and overall robustness of the system.
3. The main tool used to develop this data warehouse will be the ETL tool Microsoft SSIS.
4. With processes like extract, transform, and load, this tool will help in creating and improving business processes.
5. To garner more insights from the data, the Microsoft Power BI tool is used to create visualizations and dashboards for executive decisions. 

**Project Achievements:**
1. Gathered and analyzed functional business requirements.
2. Identified various business processes that combined both the data warehouse data into one.
3. Identified Dimensions and Fact Table that are applicable across multiple business processes and documented them.
4. Created a high-level dimensional model and a list of attributes and metrics.
5. Created a detailed dimensional model to show the combined design of the warehouse.
6. Implemented the dimensional models and tested the model by performing a Load statement using SQL-Queries for both the Databases.
7. Performed ETL implementation.
8. Extracted and staged data from data sources using SSIS.
9. Loaded all the data into the data warehouse.
10. Designed and build MOLAP cubes.
11. Visualize data using BI tools to create interactive reports and dashboards.

**Tools Used: SQL, SQL Server, ETL, SSIS, Microsoft Excel, Power BI**
