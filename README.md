# Data-Warehouse-Integration

We build a Data Warehouse for our IST 722: Data Warehouse course. We are designing a warehouse for our fictional client, Fudge Corporation Ltd. which is a conglomerate with two subsidiaries in operation â€“ FudgeMart & FudgeFlix. FudgeMart is an online retailer whereas FudgeFlix is an online DVD demand service.  

The aim of this project is to analyze the needs of these databases and decide what kind of data warehouse can be built to improve business processes and to streamline the workflow. The project will also focus on several parts like security, scalability and overall robustness of the system. The main tool used to develop this data warehouse will be ETL tool Microsoft SSIS. With processes like extract, transform and load, this tool will help in creating and improving business processes. To garner more insights from the data, Microsoft Power BI tool is used to create visualizations and dashboards for executive decisions.
